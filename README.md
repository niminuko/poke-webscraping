# BeautifulSoup: Creating the Pokédex with Webscraping
The included Juyter Notebook aims at creating a `pandas` DataFrame from [a pokemon database](https://pokemondb.net/pokedex/all), as well as collecting icon images for training a generative adversarial network in a separate Jupyter Notebook.

The `pandas` DataFrame, called `pokedex.csv`, is not unlike the typical Pokédex database found in introductory SQL tutorials; however, the product `.csv` of the included Jupyter Notebook has been made from scratch and contains image URLs to be downloaded via "helper scripts" in the aforementioned separate Jupyter Notebook.

For more information or technical details, consider viewing `Webscraping.ipynb`.
